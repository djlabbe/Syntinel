Using Git

* Branches
    - Master
    - Dev
        - < Task/Branches >

- We will be working in dev branch
- We will merge dev into master whenever we'll be updating the production environment
- Dev branch must be stable before merging into Master

Creating a branch
    - Once in dev branch create your own branch using: 'git checkout -b <name-of-branch>'
    - This will copy dev environment into your own branch

Pushing
    - Once ready ready to push, commit all changes
    - IMPORTANT: Make sure to pull from the branch you are about to push into
        EX.) If pushing to dev, pull from dev first
    - Resolve any merge conflicts if any
    - Finally push into the branch
